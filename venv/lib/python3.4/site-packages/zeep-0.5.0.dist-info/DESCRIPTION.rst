========================
Zeep: Python SOAP client 
========================

A fast and hip Python SOAP client ;-)

Highlights:
 * Modern codebase compatible with Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5 and PyPy
 * Build on top of lxml and requests
 * Supports recursive WSDL and XSD documents.
 * Supports the xsd:choice and xsd:any elements.
 * Uses the defusedxml module for handling potential XML security issues
 * Support for WSSE (UsernameToken only for now)

Features still in development include:
 * WSSE x.509 support (BinarySecurityToken)
 * Support for HTTP bindings 
 * XML validation using lxml XMLSchema's

 Please see for more information the documentation at 
 http://docs.python-zeep.org/

If you encounter bugs then please `let me know`_ . A copy of the WSDL file if
possible would be most helpful. If you are really cool then please open a PR
with the fix... :P
